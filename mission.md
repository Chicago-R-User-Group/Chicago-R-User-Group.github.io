As a volunteer, free, open, community group, our mission is to support individual useRs and the R community. Specifically, we aim to:


# **To connect and collaborate.**

```r
all_useRs <- merge(crug, world, by="people.id", all=TRUE)
```

# **To build relationships locally and globally.**

```r
community <- do.call(rbind, eapply(.GlobalEnv, identity))
```

# **To empower and inspire.**

```r
useRs <- useRs ^ Inf
```

# **To promote and engage.**

```r
View(community); stopifnot(withVisible(useRs)$visible == TRUE)
```

# **To help and educate.**

```r
?help
```
